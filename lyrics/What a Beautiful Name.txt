You were the Word at the beginning
One with God, the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You, our Christ
What a beautiful Name it is, what a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ, my King
What a beautiful Name it is, nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is, the Name of Jesus
